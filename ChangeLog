	* debian: remove debian dir, replace by unac_1.1.0-2.diff.gz that
	  appears in the CVS tree for archival but will never be distributed.
	  Debian specific stuff must not show in the sources so that debian
	  team may produce various diffs according to the debian distribution
	  and do not depend on the author. Thanks to Remi Perrot for making
	  this point clear.
