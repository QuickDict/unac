Version 1.4.0

* When unac_string finds an illegal sequence while converting,
  it replaces it with a space. For instance 1/4 ISO-8859-1 character
  is converted to 1 4 (one space four) because the fraction character
  does not exist in ISO-8859-1.

* The new unac_version function returns the version number.

Version 1.3.0

* Add support for systems that do not have UTF-16BE defined
  but only UTF-16 being implicitly big endian. It means that
  it will work with both glibc-2.1.3 and glibc-2.1.94.

* Fix occasional allocation bug

* Allocate returned buffer even if an empty string is given
  in input.

* Add more regression tests

Version 1.2.0
